# jTbl

A JSON driven HTML table builder.

Include the jTbl.js into your HTML file.

Look at the index.html for an example of a JSON script on how to use the jTbl.js.
It allows for one extra element in the table cell, such as a button, input or label.
You can add element attributes to use other element types, or you can expand the loops to include a deeper layer of elements.

Have fun...
